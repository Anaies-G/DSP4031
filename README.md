## üõ†Ô∏è Assignments Overview
These mini-projects bridge theory and practice through MATLAB implementations. Key focus areas include:
- **Filter Design** (FIR, IIR, and window-based methods)
- **Sampling Rate Conversion** (upsampling, downsampling, and aliasing effects)
- **Audio & Image Processing** (noise removal, spectral analysis, and compression)
- **System Analysis** (frequency response, pole-zero plots, and stability)
- **FFT Applications** (signal reconstruction and spectral leakage reduction)

### Example Projects
1. Designing Butterworth/Chebyshev filters for audio signals.
2. Implementing multi-rate systems for image resampling.
3. Analyzing LTI systems using Z-transform and frequency-domain methods.
